Possible use case(s)
	Body cameras
	emergency response (firefighters? -- division at NIST)


================== BODY CAMERAS ==================

Known episodes:
	webcam footage: police officers investigating black lady. Started searching vehicle. Obstructed view. Which kind of concern?
	Camera image; infer physical location from image; can be verified in physical ways. Can be used to mitigate risks of cyber-intrusion


CLASSES
=======
body cameras: sensors
location sensors: sensors


OBJECTS
=======
% Need to describe: physical interaction, logical interaction, sensing, actuation, human role
bc1, bc2,...: body cameras
actors
server
steam-tampering: events

resilience, reliability, privacy, safety, security: trustworthiness elements

cyber-security elements, physical security elements: security elements
confidentiality, integrity, availability: cyber-security elements [HOW ARE THEY LINKED TO "security"???] [WHAT ABOUT PHYSICAL SECURITY???]



% AI connected to a body camera
% body cam picking up readings, uses ML and recognizes faces, objects (e.g., weapons)
% and making recommendations to human agent, e.g. "pull gun"
% OR it can inform nearby policemen about actors, risks and recommendations

% Capture sensing info that is not visible to human, but is processed by equipment
%   face recognition, object recognition, event/activity recognition: purely logical
%   making recommendations/generating warnings: can be viewed as actuation
%     e.g. warning policeman that a gun was identified
%          OR policeman weapons are only activated/unlocked in the presence of a threat
%          OR anomaly detection: if the cam notices attempts at tampering with the stream, the input should be sent to a safer storage
%	NOTE: actor manipulating stream of images: related to integrity and possibly other elements of security
%	      so, we need some kind of notation letting us say that parts are related to elements of security



%   Are there objects to represent privacy, safety, etc.?
%   Are they in this ontology? Or in another one?
