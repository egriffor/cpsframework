1. Select a use-case
2. a. Identify Objects, Classes, Functions, Relations
   b. Generate 2-4 competency questions
      Generate 1-2 competency questions that apply to 2+ use-cases
   c. MEASURING PROGRESS/COMPLETION: Measure quality of (a) by ability to answer (b)
   d. Iteratively refine (a). Expand (b) if needed
3. Generate ontology specification
   - Map competency questions to formal queries over the ontology
   - Measure quality of the ontology by ability to answer queries
   - Iteratively refine ontology
   - If needed, iterate to step 2
4. Select another use-case and repeat
   - During the process, identify object, classes, functions, relations that
     are suitable for the upper-level ontology
