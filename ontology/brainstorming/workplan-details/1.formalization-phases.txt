PHASE 1: DISCRETE CASE
======================
         Use-case(s)    Domain knowledge    Commonsense/World knowledge
	                  ---------- FEED INTO -----------
       Objects, Classes, Functions, Relations       Competency questions
                          ---------- MAPPED TO -----------
             Ontology Specification                       Queries

Types of queries
1. Retrieval queries
     DB-like queries, purely deductive
2. Reasoning queries
     Require guess-and-check: planning, diagnostics from first principles



PHASE 2: HYBRID CASE
====================
         Use-case(s)    Domain knowledge    Commonsense/World knowledge
	                  ---------- FEED INTO -----------
Obj, Classes, Func, Rel, Numerical Variables, Constraints       Competency questions

          Hybrid Ontology Specifications                                 Queries

Numerical Constraints: equalities and inequalities over numerical variables and numerical constants/functions


Types of queries
1. Retrieval queries
     DB-like queries, purely deductive
2. Reasoning queries
     Require guess-and-check: planning, diagnostics from first principles
3. Numerical queries
     Find values of numerical parameters that safisfy all given constraints
4. Hybrid queries
     Combine 1+3, 2+3, 1+2+3
